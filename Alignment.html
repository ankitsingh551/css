    <h1>Ram Mandir</h1>
    <hr/>
    <p>
         The Ram Mandir (lit. 'Rama Temple') is a Hindu temple in Ayodhya,
         Uttar Pradesh, India. Many Hindus believe that it is located at 
         the site of Ram Janmabhoomi, the mythical birthplace of Rama, 
         a principal deity of Hinduism.[6][7]

    <h2>History</h2>
    <h3>Ancient and medieval</h3>

    <p>
        In 1528, the commander of the Mughal Empire, Mir Baqi, 
        constructed the Babri Masjid mosque, under the order of 
        Babur in the site of the Ram Janmabhoomi, the birthplace 
        of Rama.[32][page needed] The earliest record of the mosque 
        may be traced back to 1767, in the Latin book

    <p>
         The murtis (transl. sacred images) of Rama and Sita were installed 
         inside the Babri Masjid on the night of 22–23 December 1949 and the 
         devotees began to gather from the next day.[8][37] By 1950, the state
          took control of the mosque under section 145 CrPC and allowed Hindus,
          not Muslims, to perform their worship at the site.[38]
