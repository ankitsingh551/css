            The dog has been selectively bred over millennia for various behaviors,
            sensory capabilities, and physical attributes.[12] Dog breeds vary widely
            in shape, size, and color. They perform many roles for humans, such as hunting,
            herding, pulling loads, protection, assisting police and the military, companionship, 
            therapy, and aiding disabled people.

        <p>Female domestic cats can have kittens from spring to late autumn in temperate
            zones and throughout the year in equatorial regions, with litter sizes often
            ranging from two to five kittens. Domestic cats are bred and shown at events
            as registered pedigreed cats, a hobby known as cat fancy. Animal population
            control of cats may be achieved by spaying and neutering
